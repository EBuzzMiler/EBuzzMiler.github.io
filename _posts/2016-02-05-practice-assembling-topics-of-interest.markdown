This starts a new beginning for me. It provides what was a latent desire come alive. Help me better understand information technology so I can combine my knowledge and write more.

My purpose is to continue my education.  I read books but, seldom do I read within my field. Writing about information technology is a wider field than the givens. I want to move towards a goal. My IT jobs have been hampered by myopic thinking for it has felt too much like work without enjoyment. Rather than sticking to topics gleaned from work, growth will come from study.  

It's with plenty of fear and trepidation I cursor ahead to make up rules as I go.  I have been reluctant to write because I know how hard it is.  To keep providing readers meaningful content keeps them engaged for another day. 'They can check out any time they like, but they can never leave.'  

When younger, I did not want a record of my writing to pigeon hole me to the topic.  As I spend time helping others discover opportunities to learn my effort improves my writing.  I can build a portfolio too.  

Since brevity is wit, I outline what I intend to do here.

There's now more than a billion websites on the internet. That provides sources for good descriptive copy and content on applications on web.  It is the modern day theater within a theatre.  Today's  information technologies help business to understand business while helping deliver the explanations. Each making different assumptions to target their readership.  Mostly, the narrative is aimed at a busy public with a need to understand and assemble information technology hardware and software solve a business problem, help capture more market share or communicate breaking news.
 
This is a shallow purpose, but one that has to take the level of knowledge into account before seeing a connection.  What I am trying to say is some assumptions have to be made.  You have to assume the concepts and the principles of IT are both in your audience and in your main narrative as you spin up your story.  That's a kind of rhetoric I would like to be transparent as I work behind the screen to deliver a message of applications.  After all, it's the application of the technology that I want to explore. 

As a simple explanation would allow, web servers used to be used for websites to place their code on and to produce a system to be supported.  Today, the cloud has taken over this space, despite many of the server's functions to have changed slightly.  My first topic will explore how the web server and the cloud offer some of the same purposes but with different results.  

This is going to be the place where I jump in. Be patient with me dear reader, I am more green than I admit, but I am willing to grow.
