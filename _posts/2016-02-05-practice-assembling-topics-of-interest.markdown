This is a new beginning. What was a latent desire now has come alive. Helping me better understand information technology will combine knowledge as I write more and help other people learn.

My purpose is to continue an education.  I read books but, seldom in my field. Writing about information technology was a givens that I have done without study. Move me closer to the goal. My IT jobs always seemed to hamper my thinking, being too much like work without enjoyment. What's that? Rather than making a contribution to the day-to-day, I was cast in the role of reporter doing thought-casting.  

It's with plenty of fear and trepidation I go on up ahead to make the rules. I know how hard it is to write.  To provide readers content keeps them engaged for yet another day. But they can... 'check out any time they like,' but, saying, 'you can never leave,' may mean they just go somewhere else on the net.

When younger, I did not want a record of my writing thinking it would pigeon hole me.  As I spend time helping others discover opportunities, I learn my effort improves my writing.  I am building a portfolio.

Brevity is wit; I intend to outline.

Today there's more than a billion websites on the internet. To cull good descriptive copy from sources on web will have to adhere to some uniform methodology.  It is a literal equivalent to the theater-within-a-theatre.  Today's information technologies help business to understand knowledge while delivering those explanations. Each makes assumptions to target reader's with a narrative aimed at a busy public who needs to understand. 

My mission is to assemble information technology hardware and software to solve real business problems, and to communicate how companies can break down their needs and do the same thing. 
 
My purpose, takes IT knowledge and makes business connections.  We will have to assume and assimilate new concepts as never before and apply common sense while adapting principles to be shared with the broader audience. 

As I spin up this story, the narrative will be one of discovery and sharing, a sort of maker faire.  That's at the heart of the kind of magic rhetoric I would like to work in but not so transparent that the stage appears and applications knowledge sounds like school.  After all, the application of the technology to business on a case study basis to address the problem academically, but the presentation does not have to be stoic or it won't deliver. 

As the cloud takes over the old ways, many of the support functions of IT is no longer needed.  My first topic explores how a running web server through the cloud offers the same purposes but with a different result.  

Please jump in but be patient with me dear reader, I am more green than I care to admit, but willing to grow the distance. Comments will be enabled once I learn how to 'make it so.'
