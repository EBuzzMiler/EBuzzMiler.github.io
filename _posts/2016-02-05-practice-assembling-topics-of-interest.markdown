This starts a new beginning for me. It provides what was a latent desire come alive. Help me better understand information technology so I can combine my knowledge and write more.

My purpose is to continue my education.  I read books but, seldom do I read within my field. Writing about information technology is a wider field than the givens. I want to move towards a goal. My IT jobs have been hampered by myopic thinking for it has felt too much like work without enjoyment. Rather than sticking to topics gleaned from work, growth will come from daily study.  

So it's with plenty of fear and trepidation I cursor on ahead to make up rules as I go. I have been reluctant to write because I know how hard it is.  To keep providing readers meaningful content keeps them engaged for another day. They all can... 'check out any time they like, but they can never leave.'  

When younger, I did not want a record of my writing to pigeon hole me to the topic.  As I spend time helping others discover opportunities to learn my effort improves my writing.  I can build a portfolio too.  

Since brevity is wit, I'll outline what I intend to do here.

There's now more than a billion websites on the internet. That provides sources for good descriptive copy and content on applications on web.  It is the modern day theater within a theatre.  Today's  information technologies help business to understand business while helping deliver the explanations. Each making different assumptions to target their readership.  Mostly, the narrative is aimed at a busy public with a need to understand and assemble information technology hardware and software solve a business problem, help capture more market share or communicate company breaking news.
 
This is a shallow purpose, but one that takes IT knowledge and makes a connection.  Some mistakes will need to be made.  We have to assume and assimulate new concepts never before applied all while adapting solid principles of IT designed to be shared with an audience. 

So my narrative, as I spin up this story, is one of discovery and sharing.  That's a kind of magic rhetoric I would like to have working not so transparently behind the screens to an application knowledge to others.  After all, it's the application of the technology to business problems in a case like basis that will address the . 

As a simple explanation would allow, web servers used to be used for websites to place their code on and to produce a system to be supported.  Today, the cloud has taken over this space, despite many of the server's functions to have changed slightly.  My first topic will explore how the web server and the cloud offer some of the same purposes but with different results.  

This is going to be the place where I jump in. Be patient with me dear reader, I am more green than I admit, but I am willing to grow.
