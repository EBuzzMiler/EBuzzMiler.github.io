This is a new beginning for the writer in me to express a latent desire to understand information technology much better than I do at present. 

What I have known all too often is that I do not have any formal plan to continue my education.  I read books from the library all the time but seldom read books in my field of endeavor.  What this means to me is that I am growing but not towards a deliberate plan.  Sure, I have learned things but, specific learning about topics of information technology have been hampered by my thinking that it seems too much like work and academic study rather than sticking with a plan that will help me grow.  

So it's with a little trepidation I plow ahead here and make up my rules as I go.  I was always reluctant to write online or write anywhere because it seems as if the act would provide a permanent record of my waning interests.  But if that were the case it no longer is now.  I simply want to spend some time helping myself to the myriad opportunities to learn more and hopefully help other people by my effort. 

Today, since this is an introductory post, will not delve too deep into the topic, but if brevity is wit, I should outline what I actually intend to do here and see if I can get away with it. 

There's more websites on the internet that provide good descriptive copy concerning the application of web and information technologies to business, but the explanations usually make a bunch of different assumptions about their readership.  Mostly, to my mind, the definitive narratives are pointed towards a busy public with a need to understand how assembly of some simple information technology hardware and software can more efficiently run a business, help in marketing or communicate news to an audience. 
This is a shallow purpose, but one that has to take the level of knowledge into account before seeing a connection.  What I am trying to say is some assumptions have to be made.  You have to assume the concepts and the principles of IT are both in your audience and in your main narrative as you spin up your story.  That's a kind of rhetoric I would like to be transparent as I work behind the screen to deliver a message of applications.  After all, it's the application of the technology that I want to explore. 

As a simple explanation would allow, web servers used to be used for websites to place their code on and to produce a system to be supported.  Today, the cloud has taken over this space, despite many of the server's functions to have changed slightly.  My first topic will explore how the web server and the cloud offer some of the same purposes but with different results.  

This is going to be the place where I jump in. Be patient with me dear reader, I am more green than I admit, but I am willing to grow.
