This starts a new beginning for me. What was a latent desire has now come alive. Help me to better understand information technology and combine knowledge to write more and I will help people learn.

My purpose is to continue my education.  I read books but, seldom do I read in my field. Writing about information technology is a givens that I have done without much study. Move me towards the goal. My IT jobs seemed to hamper my thinking for it was too much like work without employment. What? Rather than making a contribution to the day to day, I was cast in the role of reporting thought-casting.  

So it's with plenty of fear and trepidation I cursor up ahead to make the rules as I go. I know how hard it is to write.  To provide readers content keeps them engaged for yet another day. They can... 'check out any time they like, but they can never leave.'  

When younger, I did not want a record of my writing thinking it would pigeon hole me.  As I spend time helping others discover opportunities, I learn my effort improves my writing.  I am building a portfolio.

Since brevity is wit, I'll outline what I intend to do.

There's now more than a billion websites on the internet. Try to provide good descriptive copy and valuable content from sources of applications on web.  It is the modern day theater within a theatre.  Today's  information technologies help business to understand business while helping deliver the explanations. Each making different assumptions to target their readership.  Mostly, the narrative is aimed at a busy public with a need to understand and assemble information technology hardware and software solve a business problem, help capture more market share or communicate company breaking news.
 
This is a shallow purpose, but one that takes IT knowledge and makes a connection.  Some mistakes will need to be made.  We have to assume and assimulate new concepts never before applied all while adapting solid principles of IT designed to be shared with an audience. 

So my narrative, as I spin up this story, is one of discovery and sharing.  That's a kind of magic rhetoric I would like to have working not so transparently behind the screens to an application knowledge to others.  After all, it's the application of the technology to business problems in a case like basis that will address the . 

As a simple explanation would allow, web servers used to be used for websites to place their code on and to produce a system to be supported.  Today, the cloud has taken over this space, despite many of the server's functions to have changed slightly.  My first topic will explore how the web server and the cloud offer some of the same purposes but with different results.  

This is going to be the place where I jump in. Be patient with me dear reader, I am more green than I admit, but I am willing to grow.
