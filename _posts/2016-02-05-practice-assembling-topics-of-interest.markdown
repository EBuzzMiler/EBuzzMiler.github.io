This starts a new beginning for me. What was a latent desire has now come alive. Help me to better understand information technology and combine knowledge to write more and I will help people learn.

My purpose is to continue my education.  I read books but, seldom do I read in my field. Writing about information technology is a givens that I have done without much study. Move me towards the goal. My IT jobs seemed to hamper my thinking for it was too much like work without employment. What? Rather than making a contribution to the day to day, I was cast in the role of reporting thought-casting.  

So it's with plenty of fear and trepidation I cursor up ahead to make the rules as I go. I know how hard it is to write.  To provide readers content keeps them engaged for yet another day. They can... 'check out any time they like, but they can never leave.'  

When younger, I did not want a record of my writing thinking it would pigeon hole me.  As I spend time helping others discover opportunities, I learn my effort improves my writing.  I am building a portfolio.

Since brevity is wit, I'll outline what I intend to do.

Today there's more than a billion websites on the internet. To try and provide good descriptive copy and useful content from sources on web will have to adhere to some uniform methodology.  It is a literal equivalent to the modern day theater-within-a-theatre.  Today's information technologies help business to understand knowlege while delivering the explanations. Each makes assumptions to target a reader so the narrative aimed at a busy public needs to understand. 

So my task is to assemble information technology hardware and software to solve business problems, and communicate how a company break their needs down to do the same thing. 
 
This is a purpose, one that takes IT knowledge and makes connections.  Mistakes will be made.  We will have to assume and assimilate new concepts as never before and apply common sense while adapting principles to be shared with the broader audience. 

As I spin up this story, the narrative is one of discovery and sharing.  That's a kind of magic rhetoric I would like to have working not so transparently to stage applications knowledge to help others.  After all, it's the application of the technology to business on a case study basis to address the problem. 

As a simple explanation may begin how the cloud takes over the old ways, and many of the functions no longer need to be supported.  My first topic explores how a running web server through the cloud offer the same purposes but with different results.  

Please jump in.  Be patient with me dear reader, I am more green than I admit, but I willing to grow. Comments will be enabled once I learn how to make it so.
