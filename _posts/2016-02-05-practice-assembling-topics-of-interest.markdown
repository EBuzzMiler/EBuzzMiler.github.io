This starts a new beginning for me. It provides what was once a latent desire to now come alive to help me better understand information technology. What is my purpose? To write more to combine.

I do not have a formal plan to continue my education.  I read books but, seldom read within my field. Writing about information technology is much wider a field than the givens.  It means I am want to move towards a deliberate goal. IT jobs have hampered by my thinking and have been too much like work without any academic study. Rather than sticking to a topic at work, I have decided to grow.  

So it's with a little trepidation I plow ahead and make up the rules as I go.  I have been reluctant to write online or write anywhere for that matter because I know how hard it is to provide something meaningful to say to a reader to keep him engaged.  I also did not want a permanent record of my writing to pigeon hole me to a topic.  This is no longer the case as I will spend my time helping others discover the myriad opportunities to learn and help other people by my efforts. 

Since this is introductory, let's not delve too deeply into the reasons I've just begun. If brevity is wit, I outline here what I intend to do 

There's more websites on the internet that provide good descriptive copy concerning the application of web and information technologies to business, but the explanations usually make a bunch of different assumptions about their readership.  Mostly, to my mind, the definitive narratives are pointed towards a busy public with a need to understand how assembly of some simple information technology hardware and software can more efficiently run a business, help in marketing or communicate news to an audience. 
This is a shallow purpose, but one that has to take the level of knowledge into account before seeing a connection.  What I am trying to say is some assumptions have to be made.  You have to assume the concepts and the principles of IT are both in your audience and in your main narrative as you spin up your story.  That's a kind of rhetoric I would like to be transparent as I work behind the screen to deliver a message of applications.  After all, it's the application of the technology that I want to explore. 

As a simple explanation would allow, web servers used to be used for websites to place their code on and to produce a system to be supported.  Today, the cloud has taken over this space, despite many of the server's functions to have changed slightly.  My first topic will explore how the web server and the cloud offer some of the same purposes but with different results.  

This is going to be the place where I jump in. Be patient with me dear reader, I am more green than I admit, but I am willing to grow.
